Codility lesson tasks and their solution written in python and javascript.

All rights go to Codility, these are just my solutions to their open-source problems, which can be found here: 
https://app.codility.com/programmers/lessons

Each solution got 100% overall score (correctness + performance) on the official website. 
Almost all have my own apprach/method implemented, except a few where I couldn't get 100% because of performance issues, thus I went to Google for help.
